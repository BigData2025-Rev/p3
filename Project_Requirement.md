# Project 3: US Census Data 

US Census Data is a Big Data project that analyzes the United States population from 2000 to 2020 every decade. The data contains over 60 million records, is mined into cloud storage, and is queried to answer questions posed by the project manager. The conclusions drawn from the queries suggest future trends, such as population growth for the next decade. The queries were optimized using PySpark and Spark SQL and shown visually with a data visualization tool.

# Possible Queries: 
Below is a list of possible questions to answer with Project 3. It is a suggested list of questions, and is not intended to be a complete list. You may answer more questions (or different questions).


### Population Trends and Growth
1. What are the population growth rates for each district from 2000 to 2020?
2. Which districts experienced the highest population growth or decline between census years?
3. How did urban vs. rural population distribution change over the 20 years?
4. What districts have consistently been the most populous across the three census years?
5. What percentage of districts experienced population stagnation (less than 2% change)?
### Demographic Shifts
6. What are the trends in racial composition in each district over the 20 years?
7. Which racial group experienced the most significant growth in each district?
8. How did racial diversity (using diversity indices) evolve across districts?
9. Which districts saw a racial group shift from majority to minority or vice versa?
10. What is the correlation between racial diversity and population growth in districts?
### Regional Comparisons
11. How does population growth vary by geographic region (e.g., North, South, East, West)?
12. Are there significant differences in racial composition trends among regions?
13. What regions showed the fastest racial diversification from 2000 to 2020?
14. How do population growth rates in metropolitan districts compare to non-metropolitan districts?
15. Which regions saw the greatest increase in minority population share?
### Socioeconomic Implications (Using Proxy Data)
16. How does population density correlate with changes in racial diversity?
17. Do districts with higher population growth exhibit different racial composition trends compared to districts with stagnation or decline?
18. How does the racial composition in districts align with historical urbanization trends?
19. What patterns exist in population redistribution (e.g., migration to/from certain districts)?
20. Which districts could be classified as racial melting pots based on their composition and changes?
