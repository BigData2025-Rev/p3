# P3 - U.S. Census Data 2000-2020

## Project Description
US Census Data is a Big Data project that analyzes the United States population from 2000 to 2020 every decade. The data contains over 60 million records, is mined into cloud storage, and is queried to answer questions posed by the project manager. The conclusions drawn from the queries suggest future trends, such as population growth for the next decade. The queries were optimized using PySpark and Spark SQL and shown visually with Power BI.

## Project Steps
### Data Wrangling
U.S. Census data was gathered from census.gov in legacy format for three census years: 2000, 2010, and 2020.

### Data Cleaning
The output of the wrangled data for each census year was cleaned and transformed into a dataset optimized to address a chosen set of data analysis questions.

### Data Analysis
The United States population from 2000 to 2020 was analyzed with the cleaned dataset via PySpark / Spark SQL queries and Power BI data visualizations. The results can be seen in the slideshow presentation.

## Team Credits
Amongst the 17 members who worked on this project, there were four main sub-teams. Three Data Wrangler teams (one for each census year) and one Data Cleaner team. **All members participated in the data analysis and presentation.**
